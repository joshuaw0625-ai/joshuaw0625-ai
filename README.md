# Hi, I'm Joshua 👋
### IT Support Specialist | Transitioning from Skilled Trades

I am an aspiring IT Support Specialist transitioning from a career in skilled trades (Mechanic & Construction).

For years, I diagnosed complex mechanical issues, installed critical infrastructure (Fire Sprinklers), and solved physical problems under pressure. I have learned that **troubleshooting an engine is very similar to troubleshooting a computer**: both require patience, a systematic approach, and a focus on root-cause analysis.

I am now applying that diagnostic logic to software and hardware. I don't just swap parts; I dig into the documentation to understand *why* the failure happened.
