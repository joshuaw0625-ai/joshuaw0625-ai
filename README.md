# Hi, I'm Joshua 👋
### IT Support Specialist | Transitioning from Skilled Trades

I am an aspiring IT Support Specialist transitioning from a career in skilled trades (Mechanic & Construction).

For years, I diagnosed complex mechanical issues, installed critical infrastructure (Fire Sprinklers), and solved physical problems under pressure. I have learned that **troubleshooting an engine is very similar to troubleshooting a computer**: both require patience, a systematic approach, and a focus on root-cause analysis.

I am now applying that diagnostic logic to software and hardware. I don't just swap parts; I dig into the documentation to understand *why* the failure happened.

### 📚 Current Studies
- **Google IT Support Professional Certificate:** Currently on Course 3 (Operating Systems).
- **CompTIA A+:** Studying Core 1 & 2 using Sybex guides.
- **Philosophy:** "Learn it to remember it." Prioritizing deep understanding over speed.

### 🛠️ Hardware & Home Lab
I believe the best way to learn is to build it myself.
- **Primary Workstation:** Windows 11 (Intel Pentium Gold, 16GB RAM)
- **Virtualization:** Windows 11 VMs for Active Directory & Admin practice.
- **Linux Lab:** Converted a legacy HP laptop (17-bs027ds) into a dedicated Ubuntu Linux machine.
### 📂 Projects & Repairs
*(Photos coming soon)*

### **Project 1: The "Lazarus" Laptop (HP Restoration)**
* **Problem:** Legacy hardware retiring from daily use.
* **Solution:** Wiped the drive, physically cleaned internal components, and installed Ubuntu Linux to create a dedicated sandbox for learning command line interface (CLI).
